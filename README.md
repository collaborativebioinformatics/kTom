# kTom: kmers for profiling Tomato introgressions 

### Intro statement

Important traits for vegetable markets are often obtained by crossing elite breeding germplasm to wild vegetable lines that carry a trait of interest (for example, disease resistance). The process of moving a genomic region from one species or distantly-related speices into another is called **introgression**. Identifying and tracking introgressed traits in an important function of modern tomato breeding. Some introgressions can be completely defined by de novo sequencing and assembly, but this can be expensive or incomplete.

### What's the problem?

Mapping wild or landrace introgressions into elite germplasm is difficult because many of these traits introgress as large presence/absence structural variants with novel genes/sequences that make fine mapping difficult. 

Having a reference-free method to define introgression sequences will provide more agility to understand the nature of important traits (e.g. [Voicheck & Weigel, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0612-7))

### Why should we solve it?

Using kmers (or any non-SNP approach) to tag introgressions would let usâ€¦

- Establish an orthologous fingerprint of introgressions across cultivated lines
- Investigate and viz the history of introgressions in a population
- Understand tomato population structure with a data type more able to account for SVs
- Form the basis for a kmerGWAS/SV-GWAS approach

- Data on [ERA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB5235?show=reads) or [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJEB5235)

### Next steps

* Consider different kmer size (k=21)
* Method for cleaning individual samples (e.g. remove kmers where n=1)
* Method for tabulating kmer frequency in a population
	- Consider [Voicheck method](https://github.com/voichek/kmersGWAS/blob/master/manual.pdf)
* (Validation)[docs/TomatoHakathon_Validation.pptx]
